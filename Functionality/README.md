# Functionality

## 1. Centralized Workflow
We use a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all new functionality. 
You start by cloning the Arduino-Interactive repository, meaning you have your own local copy of the project. 
You commit your developed "functionality" to the "Functionality" folder and publish it to GitHub.

## 2. Why
Everyone can make use of everyone's code!
