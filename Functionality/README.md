# Functionality

## 1. Centralized Workflow
We use a central repository to serve as the single point-of-entry for all new functionality. You start by cloning the Arduino-Interactive repository, meaning you own a local copy of the project. You commit your developed "functionality" to the Functionality map and publish it to github.

##2. Why
Everyone can make use of everyone's code!
