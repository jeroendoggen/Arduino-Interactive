# Testing the hardware
You can use the code samples in the "Testing" folder to test all the hardware components.
Most of the code in that folder is also available in the printed handouts.
Test everything separately to verify your hardware.

## LEDs
 * Open the "Blink" example.
 * Adjust the pin numbers (look at the schematic)

You can also test all the "extra pins" in the same way. (sync1, sync2, open1, open2) 

## Pushbutton
 * Open the "DigitalReadSerial" example.
 * Adjust the pin numbers (look at the schematic)
 
## Potentiometer
 * Open the "AnalogReadSerial" example.
 * Adjust the pin numbers (look at the schematic)
 
## Piezo element
 * Use the "piezo.ino" example in the "software" folder.
 * Adjust the pin numbers (look at the schematic)

## Photo resistor
 * Use the "photoresistor.ino" example in the "software" folder.
 * Adjust the pin numbers (look at the schematic)

## Optocoupler
 * Use the "optocoupler.ino" example in the "software" folder.
 * Adjust the pin numbers (look at the schematic)
